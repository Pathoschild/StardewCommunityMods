Program flow:

inject at start and return early

(5:43:33 PM) Demmonic: if you're injecting @ RETURNS, it's the return instruction number relative to other returns (0, 1, 2, 3)


on game load (or some other point suitably early in the process), set the allowable seasons of all crops to all 4 seasons
	--Can't be done.  Crops check the XNB each time they are instantiated.  Must have XNB edit for now.

on last day of fall, get a list of all hoe dirt objects in the game, save it
on first day of winter, replace the list
	--won't work, would have to do for every winter day, crops wouldn't grow in winter
	
on last day of fall, set all crops.rowInSpriteSheet to 23, which is the row for wild crops
	--drawback:  would all look like wild crops when displayed
		--would have to be very careful about switching back any time the player would be looking
		--can i get player location while he is in the farm house and set it back if near the door?
		--if we go by location, when you wake up you're still by the bed, and you don't want to fire it again.  add a tag on the daychanged code to fire it only when near bed on same day, not new day
	--drawback:  planted wild seeds are designed to sprout into random wild plants (line 355 crop.cs)
		--would have to make second condition of 3 true for seeds to sprout normally, probably advance crops one day for free
		--could remember which crops had that done and set them back a day later
		
Add seeds to seed shop inventory.  See SeedShop.cs line 155, shopStock().
